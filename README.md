## FAQ

#### How often do you update this?

It is honestly hard to say. I am coding this in my free time in highschool, so its really hard to know when I'm going to have freetime.

#### How do I reach out to you?

You can reach out to me via email or profile.

#### Why is it buggy?

Coding a clicker game is harder than it looks, so there might be bugs from time to time.
